A HTML web component for sharing links

I have been reading a lot of blog posts lately about HTML Web Components and they finally are starting to click.

So when I was reading this post from Aaron Gustafson about he's [progressively enhacing his share button](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/sharing-in-the-age-of-3p-cookie-mageddon/), sure sounded like he was describing an HTML web component. 

Scott Jehl recently walked through writing a web component for [responsive video](https://scottjehl.com/posts/even-responsiver-video/) and I used Stefan Judis' [sparkly-text](https://github.com/stefanjudis/sparkly-text) as a starting point for this project.
